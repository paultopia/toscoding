<h2 class="alert alert-success">Instructions for coding</h2>

Our project is to read a bunch of terms of service agreements on websites and collect data on some of their terms.

This site should work with current versions of Chrome on desktop. I don't know about any other browser, and I don't know about mobile devices.

#### Most important rules

1.  When you're done entering data---even if you don't enter a single agreement, you **must** click "QUIT" in the menubar up at the top. Even if you just read these instructions, you need to click quit when you're done.  **Every time** you finish what you're doing on this site and stand up from your computer, you need to click "QUIT."  Otherwise, the data could get corrupted.  

2.  We're just coding general terms of service (also known as "terms of use" or just "terms")---not "privacy policies."

#### Workflow

1. Click "Coding" in the menubar.

2.  Wait a few seconds for things to load.  A website should appear in the box in the middle of the page.  If it doesn't (some sites block embedding) click the link below the box to open it up in a new tab.

3.  Navigate to the terms of service for the embedded website.  If the website doesn't have one, then click "no" on the first question, scroll all the way to the bottom, hit "submit," and you're done with that one. But don't give up too quickly. Some sites put their terms on a page called "legal," others put them on the registration page for whatever their service is.

4.  Read the terms of service and answer the questions on the coding page. Explanations of terms in the questions are below.

5.  At the very bottom, there is a big box for text.  Copy the entire text of the terms of service from the site into that box.

6.  Hit submit.  A new site will appear in a few seconds, and you can enter data for the next one, or hit quit on top if you're done.

7.  Reminder: when you're done entering data for the site, you **must** hit quit at the top.

### Explanation of questions 

1.  "Could you find a terms of service contract?"

Some websites might not have terms of service. If so, just select "no" here, submit, and you're done.

Remember that "terms of service" might also be called "terms of use," "terms and conditions, "conditions of use," "legal," etc. 

What you're looking for is the general agreement governing the use of the services or goods the site offers. Please do not include privacy policies, even if that's the only contractual language you can find.  Sometimes terms of service are buried on the page that you use to sign up or register for a site, so be sure to check there. 

2.  "Is there a compelled arbitration clause?"

Many contracts require users to give up their right to sue in court in favor of out-of-court mandatory arbitration.  Select "yes" if this contract does so.

3.  "Is there a choice of law clause?"

Many contracts specify that disputes about the contract or the goods/services offered under it will be resolved under the law of a particular jurisdiction (like a country or a U.S. state).  Select "yes" if this contract does so.

4.   "Do users waive class actions?"

Many contracts specify that consumers give up the right to file a class action about disputes over the contract or the goods/services offered under it.  You know the drill.

5.  "Do users waive warranties?"

Select yes if the contract disclaims warranties that might otherwise exist, including express or implied warranties (like the warranties given under the Uniform Commercial Code). 

6.  "Do users assume the risk of negligence?"

Select yes if the contract either specifically says that users "assume the risk" of negligence from the company offering the contract, or (equivalently) disclaims negligence liability. Common forms this takes includes, for example, a claim that the company will not be responsible for negligent disclosure of the user's personal information or by negligently allowing third parties to commit fraud against the user.

7.      "Do users indemnify site against claims?" 

Select yes if the contract specifies that users indemnify the operator of the website against any claim. (This commonly appears where intellectual property is being posted to a website by a user or products are being sold over a website by a user, and the user agrees to indemnify the site against claims relating to things like copyright infringement or products liability. However it might appear in other forms.)

8.  "Do users grant IP rights in personal data other than for providing site services?"

Some contracts say that users give the site owner a license to use intellectual property they post to the service for things like marketing. Select yes under those circumstances, or if the contract says users grant actual ownership of intellectual property or the right to sell users' intellectual property or license rights to third parties. However, *do not* select yes if the contract merely says that users give a license to the site to use their intellectual property for the purpose of providing services. For purposes of this question, "intellectual property" includes copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, and rights of publicity and similar rights to a user's likeness. 

9.  "Does transaction claim to be a 'license' rather than a 'sale'?"

Some contracts, particularly but not exclusively for software sales, insist that the user isn't being sold anything, but merely given a license to use something. Select yes if this is the case here.

10.  "Must user use physical mail to exercise some right?"

Some contracts say "you have to mail something to this address in order to exercise this right." For example, a number of gym membership contracts make it harder to quit by saying that you have to use snail mail or even certified mail in order to quit your membership.  Select "yes" if this contract does that.
 
 11. "Does contract provide a way to opt-out of some term?"

Finally, select "yes" here if the contract offers users any way to opt out of a term. This will sometimes appear, for example, in cases where users consent to the use of their intellectual property or personal data for something, but are given a way to say "actually, no, I'm not into that." 
   
   
   **Remember to copy and paste the entire text of the contract into the box at the end, and to click submit.**
   
   **Remember to click "quit" at the top of the page after you've submitted the last contract you're working on in a particular session.**

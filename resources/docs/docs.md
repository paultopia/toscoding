<h2 class="alert alert-success">Instructions for coding</h2>

Our project is to read a bunch of terms of service agreements on websites and collect data on some of their terms.

This site should work with current versions of Chrome on desktop. I don't know about any other browser, and I don't know about mobile devices.

#### Most important rules

1.  When you're done entering data---even if you don't enter a single agreement, you **must** click "QUIT" in the menubar up at the top. Even if you just read these instructions, you need to click quit when you're done.  **Every time** you finish what you're doing on this site and stand up from your computer, you need to click "QUIT."  Otherwise, the data could get corrupted.  

2.  We're just coding general terms of service (also known as "terms of use" or just "terms")---not "privacy policies."

#### Workflow

1. Click "Coding" in the menubar.

2.  Wait a few seconds for things to load.  A website should appear in the box in the middle of the page.  If it doesn't (some sites block embedding) click the link below the box to open it up in a new tab.

3.  Navigate to the terms of service for the embedded website.  If the website doesn't have one, then click "no" on the first question, scroll all the way to the bottom, hit "submit," and you're done with that one. But don't give up too quickly. Some sites put their terms on a page called "legal," others put them on the registration page for whatever their service is.

4.  Read the terms of service and answer the questions on the coding page. Explanations of terms in the questions are below.

5.  At the very bottom, there is a big box for text.  Copy the entire text of the terms of service from the site into that box.

6.  Hit submit.  A new site will appear in a few seconds, and you can enter data for the next one, or hit quit on top if you're done.

7.  Reminder: when you're done entering data for the site, you **must** hit quit at the top.
